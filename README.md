## First we need to know what Dagger 2 is:

Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version created by Square and now maintained by Google.

## Reactive Programming

So let’s begin by providing a definition of Reactive Programming:

Reactive Programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change i.e. it is all about responding to value changes. For example, let’s say we define x = y+z. When we change the value of y or z, the value of x automatically changes. This can be done by observing the values of y and z.

Reactive Extensions is a library that follows Reactive Programming principles to compose asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequence.

RxJava is a Java based implementation of Reactive Programming.

RxAndroid is specific to Android platform which utilises some classes on top of the RxJava library.
